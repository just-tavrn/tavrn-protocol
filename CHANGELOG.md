# Changelog

Changes of the protocol that implementations must follow, newest first. Versions are the tags of this repository
(`README.md` "Versioning and capabilities").

## Unreleased

- **Permissions: layered overrides** (`permissions.md` "Evaluation", "Channel-scoped bits", "Changes"). The
  evaluation applies the role base, then the category's overrides, then the channel's own overrides; a neutral bit
  inherits from the layer below. The channel field `sync_with_category` is removed (`GET` no longer returns it,
  `PATCH` ignores it for one release). Overrides carry only the bits of `CHANNEL_SCOPED` (value `103049789951`);
  others are refused with `400 permissions.not_channel_scoped`, and nodes strip them from existing overrides at start
  (audit action `role.override_restricted`). New and changed cases in `testvectors/permissions.json` ("Layered: …");
  the vectors no longer carry `sync_with_category`.
